These four folders contain the log files from the Coarse, Medium, and Fine Searches as well as the Final Checks.

By "log files" I mean the terminal output that slurm automatically saves.

If there is a particular eigenvalue you want to investigate, use the .xlsx (Excel) file to look up which slurm ID corresponds to your eigenvalue and which search stage.
